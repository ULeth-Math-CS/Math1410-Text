{A subset of a linearly independent set is linearly independent.}
{True. Suppose $S=\{\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\ldots, \vec{v}_n\}$ is linearly independent. Let $T\subseteq S$ be a subset. By re-ordering the vectors we can assume $T=\{\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\ldots, \vec{v}_m\}$ for some $m\leq n$. It $T$ were linearly dependent, then there would exist scalars $c_1,\ldots, c_m$, not all zero, such that $c_1\vec{v}_1+\cdots +c_m\vec{v}_m=\vec{0}$. But if this is the case, then we would have $c_1\vec{v}_1+\cdots +c_m\vec{v}_m+0\vec{v}_{m+1}+\cdots +0\vec{v}_n=\vec{0}$, which is impossible if $S$ is independent.}
