\section{The Vector Space $\mathbb{R}^n$}\label{sec:Rn}
%This section introduces a collection of concepts and terminology that are at the heart of the subject of linear algebra. The reader is warned that this section is rather long and abstract. The reader may also be encouraged (or perhaps annoyed?) to know that mastery of these concepts is not essential to succeeding in Math 1410. (If you continue to Math 3410, on the other hand, your academic life will depend on understanding these ideas.) It may be productive to treat this section as a reference chapter, to be referred to whenever concepts such as linear independence or span arise later in the text.
So far in this chapter, we have restricted our attention to vectors in two or three dimensions, where we are able to visualize things geometrically. Something that you may have noticed is that the algebraic rules for the addition and scalar multiplication vectors are the same in both dimensions.
In this section, we consider this algebra of vectors abstractly, which will allow us to move beyond three dimensions to vectors with an arbitrary number of components. 

Despite the fact that we cannot easily visualize them, higher-dimensional vectors frequently arise in applications where there are many variables involved. The fact that the rules of algebra remain the same mean that we can continue to manipulate these objects, even though we can no longer picture them.

%In Section \ref{sec:matrix_arithmetic_1} we mentioned that an $n\times 1$ matrix consisting of a single column is known as a \textit{column vector}, and that column vectors are closely related to the vectors we encountered in Chapter \ref{chapter:vectors} in the cases where $n=2$ or $n=3$. 

\textbf{Remark on notation:} In the previous sections of this chapter, we have used the ``angle bracket'' notation for vectors. This notation, which is common in calculus, physics, and engineering textbooks, is popular because it reinforces the connection between vectors and points (and presumably, because it fits nicely on the page). However, in later chapters, when we study systems of equations and matrix multiplication, we will see that this notation is not as natural as the column vector notation introduced below. For the remainder of the text, we will write our vectors as \textit{column vectors}\index{vector ! column}, as indicated in Definition \ref{def:spaceRn} below.


For each positive integer $n$, a column vector $\vec{x}$ is formed by arranging $n$ real numbers $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ into a column $\vec{x} = \bbm x_1\\x_2\\\vdots \\x_n\ebm$. In Chapter \ref{chapter:algebra} we will see that this is a special type of \textit{matrix}; for now, we can think of a column vector as an alternative to the notation $\langle x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n\rangle$ encountered earlier in this chapter. In particular, we still refer to the numbers $x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n$ in $\vec{x}$ as the \sword{components} of $\vec{x}$, and we define addition and scalar multiplication of column vectors in terms of their components, as we did for vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. 

That is, given vectors $\vec{x} = \bbm x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\ebm$ and $\vec{y} = \bbm y_1\\y_2\\\vdots \\y_n\ebm$, and a scalar $c$, we define
\[
\vec{x}+\vec{y} = \bbm x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\ebm + \bbm y_1\\y_2\\\vdots \\y_n\ebm = \bbm x_1+y_1\\x_2+y_2\\\vdots \\x_n+y_n\ebm
\]
and
\[
c\vec{x} = c\bbm x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\ebm = \bbm cx_1\\cx_2\\\vdots\\cx_n\ebm.
\]

With these operations, the set of all $n\times 1$ column vectors provides an example of what is known as a \sword{vector space}.\index{vector space} 



\definition{def:spaceRn}{The vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$}{
\index{vector space ! of column vectors}
The space of all \sword{column vectors} of real numbers is denoted by
\[
\mathbb{R}^n = \left\{\left.\bbm x_1\\x_2 \\ \vdots \\x_n\ebm \,\,\right| \, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\in \mathbb{R}\right\}.
\]}

As with the vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$ we encountered in Chapter \ref{chapter:vectors}, we allow the notation $\mathbb{R}^n$ to represent both the \textit{space} of points $(x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n)$, and the set of vectors defined within that space. Since we can identify any point $P$ with the position vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$, the difference between viewing $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a set of points or as a set of vectors is primarily one of perspective.

When $n\geq 4$ we can no longer visualize vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as we did in Chapter \ref{chapter:vectors}, but we can handle them algebraically exactly as we did before, and we can extend the definitions of Chapter \ref{chapter:vectors} to apply to vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

In particular, we can define the \sword{length} of a vector 
\[
\vec{x}=\bbm x_1\\x_2\\ \vdots\\ x_n\ebm\in\mathbb{R}^n
\] 
by
\[
\len{\vec{x}} = \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots +x_n^2},
\]
and the dot product of vectors $\vec{x}, \vec{y}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ by
\[
\dotp xy = x_1y_1+x_2y_2+\cdots + x_ny_n.
\]
Having defined the dot product, we can still declare two vectors $\vec x$ and $\vec y$ to be orthogonal if $\dotp xy = 0$, and define the angle between two vectors by requiring that the identity
\[
\dotp xy = \len{\vec{x}}\len{\vec{y}}\cos\theta
\]
remain valid. Using these definitions, along with Theorem \ref{thm:addition_properties}, we can see that all of the properties of vector operations given in Theorem \ref{thm:vector_properties} remain valid in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

\smallskip

\theorem{thm:Rn_properties}{Algebraic properties of $\R^n$}{
The following properties hold for the space $\R^n$ of $n\times 1$ column vectors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$ is also a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\item For any vectors $\vec v, \vec w$, $\vec v + \vec w = \vec w+ \vec v$.
\item For any vectors $\vec u, \vec v, \vec w$, $(\vec u + \vec v)+\vec w = \vec u + (\vec v + \vec w)$.
\item For any vector $\vec v$, $\vec v+\vec 0 = \vec v$.
\item For any vector $\vec v$, we can define $-\vec v$ such that $\vec v + (-\vec v) = \vec 0$.
\item If $k$ is a scalar and $\vec v$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $k\vec v$ is also a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\item For any vector $\vec v$, $1\cdot \vec v = \vec v$.
\item For any scalars $c, d$ and any vector $\vec v$, $c(d\vec v) = (cd)\vec v)$.
\item For any scalar $c$ and vectors $\vec v$, $\vec w$, $c(\vec v+\vec w) = c\vec v+c\vec w$.
\item For any scalars $c, d$ and vector $\vec v$, $(c+d)\vec v = c\vec v+d\vec v$.
\end{enumerate}
}

\mnote{.5}{Vector spaces are defined in general to be sets on which one can define addition and scalar multiplication satisfying the algebraic properties given in Theorem \ref{thm:Rn_properties}. Examples of vector spaces other than $\R^n$ include the space of $m\times n$ matrices (each choice of $m$ and $n$ gives a different space), and the space of all polynomial functions of a real variable. Students interested in learning more about abstract vector spaces should continue on to Math 3410 after completing this course.}

Then ten properties listed in Theorem \ref{thm:Rn_properties} are known as the \sword{vector space axioms}. Any set of objects satisfying these axioms is known as a \sword{vector space}. There are many interesting examples of vector spaces other than $\mathbb{R}^n$, but we will not study vector spaces in general in this text. 

\subsection*{Linear combinations and span}
One of the key insights of linear algebra is that a space such as $\mathbb{R}^n$, which contains infinitely many objects, can be generated using the operations of addition and scalar multiplication from a finite set of basic objects. We saw in Chapter \ref{chapter:vectors}, for example, that every vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be written in terms of just three basic unit vectors $\veci$, $\vecj$, and $\veck$.

Since addition and scalar multiplication are the main operations of linear algebra, it's not too surprising (if a little unimaginative) that any combination of these operations is called a \sword{linear combination}. 

\mnote{.3}{We already defined linear combinations of matrices, and of course column vectors are a special case, but we repeat the definition in the context of $\R^n$ as a reminder.}

\smallskip

\definition{def:linear_comb_Rn}{Linear combination in $\mathbb{R}^n$}{
A \sword{linear combination}\index{linear combination} in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is any expression of the form
\[
c_1\vec{v}_1+c_2\vec{v_2}+\cdots + c_k\vec{v}_k,
\]
where $c_1,c_2\,\ldots, c_k\in \mathbb{R}$ are scalars, and $\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \ldots, \vec{v}_k\in\mathbb{R}^n$ are vectors.}

\medskip

\example{ex_lincombRn}{Forming linear combinations}{
Let $\vec{u} = \bbm 2\\-1\\3\ebm, \vec{v} = \bbm -4\\ 6\\ 3\ebm, \vec{w} = \bbm 2\\3\\12\ebm$ be vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Form the following linear combinations:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $3\vec{u}-4\vec{w}$
\item $\vec{u}+\vec{v}-2\vec{w}$
\item $7\vec{v}+3\vec{v}$
\item $3\vec{u}+\vec{v}-\vec{w}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item To simplify the linear combination, we first take care of the scalar multiplication, and then perform the addition. (We choose to interpret this expression as $3\vec{u}+(-4)\vec{w}$, and multiply by $-4$ in the first step, and add in the second step, rather than multiplying by 4 and then subtracting.)
\[
3\vec{u}-4\vec{w}  = 3\bbm 2\\-1\\3\ebm -4\bbm 2\\3\\12\ebm
 = \bbm 6\\-3\\9\ebm + \bbm -8\\-12\\-48\ebm
 = \bbm -2\\-15\\-39\ebm.
\]

\item We proceed as with the previous problem, this time performing the scalar multiplication of $\vec{w}$ by $-2$ in our heads:
\[
\vec{u}+\vec{v}-2\vec{w}  = \bbm 2\\-1\\3\ebm + \bbm -4\\6\\3\ebm + \bbm -4\\-6\\-24\ebm = \bbm -6\\-1\\-18\ebm.
\]

\item We find
\[
7\vec{u}+3\vec{v} = 7\bbm 2\\-1\\3\ebm+3\bbm -4\\6\\3\ebm = 
\bbm 14\\-7\\21\ebm+\bbm -12\\18\\9\ebm = \bbm 2\\11\\30\ebm.
\]

\item For our last example, we compute
\[
3\vec{u}+\vec{v}-\vec{w} = \bbm 6\\-3\\9\ebm + \bbm -4\\6\\3\ebm - \bbm 2\\3\\12\ebm = \bbm 0\\0\\0\ebm.
\]
\end{enumerate}
}

\medskip

Notice that in the last example above, our linear combination works out to be the zero vector. Let's think about this geometrically for a second: using the ``tip-to-tail'' method for adding vectors and beginning with the tail of $3\vec{u}$ at the origin, if we add the vector $\vec{v}$ at the tip of $3\vec{u}$, and then subtract $\vec{w}$, we end up back at the origin. The vectors $3\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$, and $\vec{w}$ must therefore lie in the same plane, since they form three sides of a triangle, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:lindeptriangle}.

\mfigure[width=\marginparwidth]{.25}{Depicting the linear combination in Example \ref{ex_lincombRn}.4}{fig:lindeptriangle}{figures/lineardep}

Viewed another way, notice that we can solve the equation $3\vec{u}+\vec{v}-\vec{w}=\vec{0}$ for $\vec{w}$: we have
\[
\vec{w} = 3\vec{u}+\vec{v}.
\]
What this tells us is that when we're being asked to form linear combinations of the vectors $\vec{u}, \vec{v}$, and $\vec{w}$ in Example \ref{ex_lincombRn}, then vector $\vec{w}$ is redundant. Suppose the vector $\vec{x}$ is an arbitrary linear combination of these vectors; that is,
\[
\vec{x} = a\vec{u}+b\vec{v}+c\vec{w}
\]
for some scalars $a,b,c$. If we plug in $\vec{w} = 3\vec{u}+\vec{v}$, then we get
\begin{align*}
\vec{x} &= a\vec{u}+b\vec{v}+c(3\vec{u}+\vec{v})\\
& = a\vec{u}+b\vec{v}+3c\vec{u}+c\vec{v} \tag*{distribute the scalar}\\
& = (a+3c)\vec{u} + (b+c)\vec{v} \tag*{collect terms.}
\end{align*}
Thus, $\vec{x}$ has been written in terms of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ only.

These ideas come up frequently enough in Linear Algebra that they have associated terminology. The definitions that follow seem innocent enough, but their importance to the theory of Linear Algebra cannot be understated.

\smallskip

\definition{def:span}{The span of a set of vectors}{
Let $A = \{\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \ldots, \vec{v}_k\}$ be a set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The \sword{span}\index{span} of the vectors in $A$, denoted $\operatorname{span}(A)$ is the set $S$ of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in $A$. That is,
\[
S = \operatorname{span}(A) = \{c_1\vec{v}_1+c_2\vec{v}_2+\cdots + c_k\vec{v}_k \,|\, c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k \in \mathbb{R}\}.
\]}

\medskip

\example{ex_spanRn}{Describing spans in $\mathbb{R}^3$}{
Let $\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w}$ be as in Example \ref{ex_lincombRn}. Describe the following spans:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u}\}$
\item $\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u},\vec{v}\}$
\item $\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w}\}$
\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item As a set, we have
\[
\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u}\} = \left\{\left.t\bbm 2\\-1\\3\ebm \, \right|\, t\in \mathbb{R}\right\},
\]
the set of all scalar multiplies of the vector $\vec{u}$. If we think back to Section \ref{sec:lines}, we can do a bit better with our description. The set $\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u}\}$ consists of all vectors $\bbm x\\y\\z\ebm$ such that
\[
\bbm x\\y\\z\ebm = t\bbm 2\\-1\\3\ebm = \bbm 0\\0\\0\ebm + t\bbm 2\\-1\\3\ebm,
\]
which we recognize as the equation of a line through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the direction of the vector $\vec{u}$.

\item Again, as a set we can write
\[
\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u},\vec{v}\} = \left\{\left.s\bbm 2\\-1\\3\ebm+t\bbm -4\\6\\3\ebm \, \right| \, s,t\in \mathbb{R}\right\},
\]
so $\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u},\vec{v}\}$ consists of all vectors of the form $\bbm 2s-4t\\-s+6t\\3s+3t\ebm$, where $s$ and $t$ can be any real numbers. Again, with a bit of thought, we can come up with a geometric description of this set. Consider an arbitrary vector
\[
\vec{x} = s\vec{u}+t\vec{v} \in \operatorname{span}\{\vec{u},\vec{v}\}.
\]
Any such vector can be obtained by moving some distance (measured by the scalar $s$) in the direction of $\vec{u}$, and then moving another distance (measured by the scalar $t$) in the direction of $\vec{v}$. We now have two directions in which to move, and if we haven't forgotten what we learned in Section \ref{sec:planes}, this probably reminds us of the description of a plane.

To see that $\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u},\vec{v}\}$ is indeed a plane, we compute
\[
\vec{n} = \vec{u}\times\vec{v} = \bbm -21\\-18\\8\ebm,
\]
which we know is orthogonal to both $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$. It follows from the properties of the dot product that for any other vector $\vec{x}=s\vec{u}+t\vec{v}$ we have
\[
\dotp nx = \vec{n}\boldsymbol{\cdot}(s\vec{u}+t\vec{v}) = s(\dotp ns) + t(\dotp nv) = s(0)+t(0)=0,
\]
so with $\vec{x} = \bbm x\\y\\z\ebm$, we have
\[
-21x-18y+8z=0,
\]
which is the equation of a plane through the origin.

\item In the discussion following Example \ref{ex_lincombRn} we saw that any vector that can be written as a linear combination of $\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$, and $\vec{w}$ can be written as a linear combination of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ alone. Thus, the span of $\vec{u}, \vec{v}$,  and $\vec{w}$ doesn't contain anything we didn't already have in the span of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$; that is,
\[
\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}\}=\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u},\vec{v}\}.
\]
\end{enumerate}

\vskip-1.5\baselineskip
}


\mnote{.5}{For any plane through the origin, the sum of two vectors that lie in that plane (or indeed, any linear combination of vectors in the plane) is again a vector in that plane. We'll see shortly that this is the distinguishing characteristic of any \textit{subspace} of $\mathbb{R}^n$.}

\medskip

\example{ex_spanRn2}{Determining membership in a span}{
Given the vectors $\vec{u} = \bbm 2\\-1\\1\ebm$, $\vec{v} = \bbm 3\\2\\5\ebm$, and $\vec{w} = \bbm -2\\5\\3\ebm$, determine whether or not the following vectors belong to $\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}\}$:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\vec{x} = \bbm 3\\6\\9\ebm$
\item $\vec{y} = \bbm 4\\1\\-3\ebm$
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
}
{
We do not yet have a general technique for solving problems of this type. Notice that the question ``Does $\vec{x}$ belong to the span of $\{\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}\}$?'' is equivalent to the question, ``Do there exist scalars $a,b,c$ such that
\[
a\vec{u}+b\vec{v}+c\vec{w}=\vec{x}?
\]
Answering this question amounts to solving a system of linear equations: if we plug in our vectors, we have
\[
a\bbm 2\\-1\\1\ebm + b\bbm 3\\2\\5\ebm + c\bbm -2\\5\\3\ebm = \bbm 2a+3b-2c\\-a+2b+5c\\a+5b+3c\ebm = \bbm 3\\6\\9\ebm.
\]
By definition of the equality of vectors, this amounts to the system of equations
\[\arraycolsep=2pt
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
2a&+&3b&-&2c&=&3\\
-a&+&2b&+&5c&=&6\\
a&+&5b&+&3c&=&9
\end{array}
\]
We will develop systematic techniques for solving such systems in the next Chapter. Until then, is there anything we can say? The very astute reader might notice that the vectors $\vec{u},\vec{v}, \vec{w}$ all have something in common: their third component is the sum of the first two: $1=2+(-1)$ for $\vec{u}$, $5=3+2$ for $\vec{v}$, and $3=-2+5$ for $\vec{w}$. Thus, all three vectors are of the form $\bbm x\\y\\x+y\ebm$. Now, notice what happens if we combine two such vectors:
\[
s\bbm a\\b\\a+b\ebm+t\bbm c\\d\\c+d\ebm = \bbm sa+tc\\sb+td\\s(a+b)+t(c+d)\ebm = \bbm sa+tc\\sb+td\\(sa+tc)+(sb+td)\ebm,
\]
which is another vector of the same form. The same will be true for combinations of three or more such vectors. For the vector $\vec{x}$, we check that $3+6=9$, so $\vec{x}$ has the correct form, and indeed (with a bit of ``guess and check'' work, we find that $a=b=c=1$ works, since $\vec{u}+\vec{v}+\vec{w}=\vec{x}$. Thus, we can conclude that
\[
\vec{x}\in\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}\}.
\]
For the vector $\vec{y}$, we add the first two components, getting $4+1=5\neq -3$. Since the third component is not the sum of the first two, there is no way that $\vec{y}$ could belong to the span of $\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$, and $\vec{w}$.
}

\medskip


\subsection*{Linear independence}% and subspaces}
Notice in Example \ref{ex_spanRn} that the span did not change when we added the vector $\vec{w}$ to the set of spanning vectors. This was probably not too surprising, since we saw that $\vec{w} = 3\vec{u}+\vec{v}$, meaning that $\vec{w}$ is a linear combination of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$, and thus,
\[
\vec{w}\in\operatorname{span}\{\vec{u},\vec{v}\}.
\]
We don't get anything new when we include the vector $\vec{w}$ since it lies in the plane spanned by $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$. We say that the vector $\vec{w}$ \textit{depends} on $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$, in the same way that the total of a sum depends on the numbers being added. Since this dependence is defined in terms of linear combinations, we say that the vectors $\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}$ are \sword{linearly dependent}.\index{linearly dependent}\index{dependent ! linear} In general, a set of vectors $\vec{v}_1,\ldots, \vec{v}_k$ is linearly dependent of one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others. If this is impossible, we say that the vectors are \sword{linearly independent}.\index{linearly independent}\index{independent ! linear} The formal definition is as follows.

\smallskip

\mnote{.25}{For reasons that become apparent as soon as one begins a discussion of basis and dimension (something we won't really cover in this text), we must consider any set containing the zero vector to be  linearly dependent. If we use Equation \eqref{eq:linearindep} to define linear independence, this is included in the definition: if (for example) $\vec{v}_1=\vec{0}$, then we can let $c_1$ be any real number we want, and $c_1\vec{v}_1=\vec{0}$, so it is possible to find a linear combination where not all of the scalars are zero.}

\definition{def:linearindepRn}{Linear dependence}{We say that a set of vectors
\[

\example{ex_linindepRn}{Determining linear independence}{
Determine whether or not following sets of vectors are linearly independent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The vectors $\vec{u} = \bbm 2\\-1\\1\ebm$, $\vec{v} = \bbm 3\\2\\5\ebm$, and $\vec{w} = \bbm -2\\5\\3\ebm$ from Example \ref{ex_spanRn2}.

\]
\end{enumerate}
}
{
Like problems involving span, a general approach to answering questions like these about linear independence will have to wait until we develop methods for solving systems of equations in the next chapter. However, for these two sets of vectors, we can reason our way to an answer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Here, we noticed that all three vectors satisfy the condition $z=x+y$, if we label their respective components as $x$, $y$, and $z$. But this condition is simply the equation of a plane; namely, $x+y-z=0$. Intuition tells us that any plane can be written as the span of \textit{two} vectors, so we can expect that any one of the three vectors can be written in terms of the other two, and indeed, this is the case. With a bit of guesswork (or by asking a computer), we can determine that
\[
\vec{w} = -\frac{19}{7}\vec{u}+\frac{8}{7}\vec{v},
\]
showing that $\vec{w}$ can be written as a linear combination of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$, and thus, that our vectors are linearly dependent.

\item Here, we make the useful observation that two of our three vectors have zero as their third component. Since $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{z}$ have third component zero, it is impossible for $\vec{y}$ to be written as a linear combination of $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{z}$, since any such linear combination would still have a zero in the third component. To see that $\vec{x}$ cannot be written in terms of $\vec{y}$ and $\vec{z}$, notice that for any $a$ and $b$,
\[
a\vec{y}+b\vec{z} = \bbm -2a+b\\3a+b\\a\ebm.
\]
If this is to equal $\vec{x}$, then we must have $a=0$, giving us $\vec{x}=b\vec{z}$, but it's clear that $\vec{x}$ is not a scalar multiple of $\vec{z}$. A similar argument shows that $\vec{z}$ cannot be written in terms of $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$, and thus our vectors are linearly independent.
\end{enumerate}
}

\medskip

Another way to characterize linear independence is as follows: suppose we have a linear combination equal to the zero vector:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:linearindep}
c_1\vec{v}_1+c_2\vec{v}_2+\cdots +c_k\vec{v}_k = \vec{0}.
\end{equation}
This is always possible of course, since we can simply set each of the scalars equal to zero. The condition of linear independence tells us that if our vectors are independent, then this is the \textbf{only} way to obtain a linear combination equal to the zero vector. 

To see why this rule works, suppose we can choose our scalars in Equation \eqref{eq:linearindep} so that at least one of them is non-zero. For simplicity, let's say $c_1\neq 0$. Then we can rewrite \eqref{eq:linearindep} as
\[
c_1\vec{v}_1 = -c_2\vec{v}_2-\cdots - c_k\vec{v}_k,
\]
and since $c_1\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $c_1$, and we've written $\vec{v}_1$ as a linear combination of the remaining vectors.

For example, from Example \ref{ex_linindepRn} we can conclude (with a bit of rearranging) that the vectors $\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$, and $\vec{w}$ satisfy the relationship
\[
19\vec{u}-8\vec{v}+7\vec{w} = \vec{0}.
\]



Linear independence can be a difficult concept at first, but in three dimensions we can use Equation \eqref{eq:linearindep} to provide a visual interpretation on a case-by-case basis.

\keyidea{idea:indepvect}{Linearly independent sets of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Any set $\{\vec{u}\}$ containing a single vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is linearly dependent if $\vec{u}=\vec{0}$, and independent otherwise. (Here \eqref{eq:linearindep} becomes $c\vec{u}=\vec{0}$. If $\vec{u}\neq\vec{0}$, the only solution is to take $c=0$.)

\item Any set $\{\vec{u},\vec{v}\}$ containing two non-zero vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is linearly dependent if $\vec{u}$ is parallel to $\vec{v}$, and independent otherwise. (In other words, two \textit{dependent} vectors lie on the same line. Two independent vectors span a plane.)

\item Any set $\{\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}\}$ of three non-zero vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is linearly dependent if all three vectors lie in the same plane, and independent otherwise.

\item Any set of four or more vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is automatically linearly dependent.

\mnote{.3}{At this point in the text, we're not in a position to prove that any set of four vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (or more generally, $k$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $k>n$) is automatically independent. However, we'll soon see in Chapter \ref{chapter:linear} that in this case, the test for independence given by Equation \eqref{eq:linearindep} results in a ``homogeneous'' system of linear equations with more variables than equations, and that such a system is guaranteed to have non-trivial solutions.}

\medskip

This section introduced several new ideas. Some, like linear combinations, are straightforward. Others, like span and linear independence, take some getting used to. There remain two very obvious questions to address:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How do we tell whether or not a given vector belongs to the span of a set of vectors?
\item How do we tell if a set of vectors is linearly independent?
\end{enumerate}
It turns out that both questions lead to \sword{systems of linear equations}. As we saw in Example \ref{ex_spanRn2}, we are currently unable to systematically solve such problems.  In Chapters \ref{chapter:linear} and \ref{chapter:algebra} we will develop the techniques needed to systematically solve such systems, at which point we will be able to easily answer questions about linear independence and span.

To see how such systems arise, suppose we want to know whether or not the vector $\vec w = \bbm 2\\-1\\3\\0\ebm \in\mathbb{R}^4$ belongs to 
%the subspace
 $V = \operatorname{span}\{\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \vec{v}_3\}$, where
\[
\vec{v}_1 = \bbm 0\\2\\-1\\4\ebm, \vec{v}_2 = \bbm 3\\1\\0\\-4\ebm, \vec{v}_3 = \bbm -3\\6\\7\\2\ebm.
\]
By definition, $V$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors $\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \vec{v}_3$, so saying that $\vec w \in V$ is the same as saying that we can write $\vec w$ as a linear combination of these vectors. Thus, what we want to know is whether or not there exist scalars $x_1, x_2, x_3$ such that
\[
\vec w = x_1\vec{v}_1 + x_2\vec{v}_2 + x_3\vec{v}_3.
\]
Substituting in the values for our vectors, this gives
\[
x_1\bbm 0\\2\\-1\\4\ebm + x_2\bbm 3\\1\\0\\-4\ebm + x_3\bbm -3\\6\\7\\2\ebm  = \bbm 3x_2-3x_3\\2x_1+x_2+6x_3\\-x_1+7x_3\\4x_1-4x_2+2x_3\ebm = \bbm 2\\-1\\3\\0\ebm .
\]
Since two vectors are equal if and only if each component is equal, the above vector equation leads to the following system of four equations:
\[\arraycolsep=2pt
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
 & &3x_2&-&3x_3&=&2\\
2x_1&+&x_2&+&6x_3&=&-1\\
-x_1& & &+&7x_3&=&3\\
4x_1&-&4x_2&+&2x_3&=&0
\end{array}
\]
Thus, the question ``Is the vector $\vec w$ an element of $V$?'' is equivalent to the question ``Is there a solution to the above system of equations?'' 

Questions about linear independence are similar, but not quite the same. With the above example involving span, what we wanted to know is ``Does a solution exist?'' With linear independence, it is not whether a solution exists that is in doubt, but whether or not that solution is \textit{unique}. For example, suppose we wanted to know if the vectors in our span example above are linearly independent. We would start with the vector equation
\[
x_1\vec{v}_1+x_2\vec{v}_2+x_3\vec{v}_3 = \vec 0,
\]
and ask whether or not there are any solutions other than $x_1=x_2=x_3=0$. This vector equation leads to a system just like the one above, except that the numbers to the right of the $=$ signs would all be zeros. The techniques needed to answer these and other questions will be developed beginning in Chapter \ref{chapter:linear}.

Before moving on to our study of systems of equations, however, we need to take some time to define \sword{matrix multiplication} and explore some of its properties.
