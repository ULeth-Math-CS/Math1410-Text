This is a textbook on Linear Algebra, designed to be compatible with the curriculum for the course Math 1410 at the University of Lethbridge. As this is a first-year course taken primarily by non-majors, the focus of the text (and the course) is primarily computational, and as a result, much of the theory that common to many first courses in linear algebra is not included.

The book does, however, contain a few topics not always found in a linear algebra course (but required for Math 1410), including vector geometry and complex numbers.

The book is \textit{free}, in every sense of the word. There is no cost to the student, unless one wants a hard copy, in which case the only cost is that of having it printed. The text is also free in less tangible, but equally important ways. The book is licensed under a Creative Commons Public License, which allows you to share the book with others, and even make and distribute copies, as long as this is not done for financial gain. The book is also \textit{open source}: all of the code and figures used to generate the text (over 2,000 files in all) are available online and can be downloaded and edited by anyone wishing to create their own version of the book.

The book has a few quirks compared to other texts. There is an extensive treatment of the arithmetic of complex numbers, since this is required in the Math 1410 course. The treatment of systems of equations also appears quite late in the textbook. In my experience, when the course begins with systems of equations, many students tune out early, either because the material is too easy, or too boring, and aren't able to get back up to speed once the level of difficulty picks up. Having some challenging material early on provides some incentive to do the homework and seek help from the beginning.

Since Math 1410 does not align well with the standard linear algebra curriculum found in many American universities, it was not possible to work with any one pre-existing open textbook. Instead, this book is an amalgamation of three texts, as specified on the copyright page, along with a substantial chunk of content that I've added myself. As a result, you'll find that there are slight differences in the format of some chapters.

The treatment of standard topics like basis and dimension is quite limited, due to the nature of the course. Arguments are provided in support of most theorems in the text, but there aren't too many formal proofs. Some topics that are sometimes taught in Math 1410 also receive a limited treatment here. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are covered, but diagonalization is not. The coverage of orthogonality is limited to the shortest distance applications in the chapter on vector geometry. In some cases these omissions are due to time constraints, both in the preparation of the textbook and in the delivery of the material in the classroom. In some cases (such as the Gram-Schmidt procedure and orthogonal diagonalization), there was a concious decision to omit material that more rightly belongs in a second course in linear algebra.

With any luck, the book will continue to evolve as I and other instructors use it. The book is a work in progress, and is bound to have some failings. If you encounter any errors as you use the book (or if you don't like how something is presented, or if you think more exercises of a certain type are needed, etc.) please let me know, and I'll do my best to make the changes.

Without their hard work, and willingness to make their books (and the source code) freely available, it would not have been possible to create an affordable textbook for this course.
