Math 1410 preface goes here...

The book is very much a work in progress, and I will be editing it regularly. Feedback is always welcome.

\noindent\textbf{\large Acknowledgements}\\

First and foremost, I need to thank the authors of the textbooks that provide the source material for this text. Without their hard work, and willingness to make their books (and the source code) freely available, it would not have been possible to create an affordable textbook for this course. You can find the original textbooks at their websites:
