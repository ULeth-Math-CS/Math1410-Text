{$c_A(x) = (x-1)^2(x-2)$\\
 Eigenvalue $\lambda_1=1$ has algebraic multiplicity 2 and geometric multiplicity 1.\\
 Eigenvalue $\lambda_2=2$ has algebraic and geometric multiplicity 1.\\
 Since the geometric multiplicity of $\lambda_1$ is less than its algebraic multiplicity, no such $P$ exists; the matrix cannot be diagonalized.}
