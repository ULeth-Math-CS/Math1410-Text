{ According to Theorem \ref{realfactorization} in Section \ref{ComplexZeros}, the polynomial $p(x) = x^{4} + 4$ can be factored into the product linear and irreducible quadratic factors.  In Exercise \ref{factorpolywithnonlinear} in Section \ref{NonLinear}, we showed you how to factor this polynomial into the product of two irreducible quadratic factors using a system of non-linear equations.  Now that we can compute the complex fourth roots of $-4$ directly, we can simply apply the Complex Factorization Theorem, Theorem \ref{complexfactorization}, to obtain the linear factorization $p(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))(x - (-1 + i))(x - (-1 - i))$.  By multiplying the first two factors together and then the second two factors together, thus pairing up the complex conjugate pairs of zeros Theorem \ref{conjugatepairsthm} told us we'd get, we have that $p(x) = (x^{2} - 2x + 2)(x^{2} + 2x + 2)$.  Use the 12 complex $12^{\text{th}}$ roots of 4096 to factor $p(x) = x^{12} - 4096$ into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic factors.}
{ $p(x) = x^{12} - 4096 = (x - 2)(x + 2)(x^{2} + 4)(x^{2} - 2x + 4)(x^{2} + 2x + 4)(x^{2} - 2\sqrt{3}x + 4)(x^{2} + 2\sqrt{3} + 4)$}
