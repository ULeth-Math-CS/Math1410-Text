{A subset of a linearly dependent set is linearly dependent.}
{False. The set $\left\{\bbm 1\\0\ebm, \bbm 0\\1\ebm, \bbm 1\\1\ebm\right\}$ is linearly dependent, since $\bbm 1\\1\ebm = \bbm 1\\0\ebm+\bbm 0\\1\ebm$, but the subset $\left\{\bbm 1\\0\ebm,\bbm 0\\1\ebm\right\}$ is clearly linearly independent.}
