{$c_A(x) = x^2-7x+14$\\
 Eigenvalue $\lambda_1=\frac{1}{2}(7+i\sqrt{7})$ has algebraic and geometric multiplicity 1.\\
 Eigenvalue $\lambda_2=\frac{1}{2}(7-i\sqrt{7})$ has algebraic and geometric multiplicity 1.\\
The matrix cannot be diagonalized over the real numbers. Over the complex numbers, we have $P = \bbm (1+i\sqrt{7})/2&(1-i\sqrt{7})/2\\1&1\ebm$.}
